# In Ruby, what does the "self" keyword refer to, and how is it used in different contexts?

In Ruby, the "self" keyword refers to the current object, or the object that is receiving the current message or method call. It's a special variable that refers to the instance of the class on which the current method is being called or the current context is being evaluated.

Here's how "self" is used in different contexts:

1. **Inside Instance Methods**:
   - Inside instance methods, "self" refers to the instance of the class on which the method is being called.
   - It allows you to access the instance variables and methods of that particular object.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     class MyClass
       def initialize(value)
         @value = value
       end

       def show_value
         puts self.inspect   # "self" refers to the current object
         puts @value         # Accessing instance variable directly
       end
     end

     obj = MyClass.new(10)
     obj.show_value
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     #<MyClass:0x00007fa0bf8b0df0>
     10
     ```

2. **Inside Class Methods**:
   - Inside class methods, "self" refers to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class.
   - It allows you to define class-level behavior or access class-level variables.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     class MyClass
       def self.class_method
         puts self.inspect   # "self" refers to the class
         puts "This is a class method."
       end
     end

     MyClass.class_method
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     MyClass
     This is a class method.
     ```

3. **For Method Chaining**:
   - "self" is often used in method chaining to refer to the current object and allow for consecutive method calls on the same object.
   - Example:
     ```ruby
     class MyClass
       def foo
         puts "foo"
         self       # Returning "self" to allow method chaining
       end

       def bar
         puts "bar"
       end
     end

     obj = MyClass.new
     obj.foo.bar
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     foo
     bar
     ```

Understanding "self" is crucial for working effectively with object-oriented programming in Ruby and for writing clear and concise code.
