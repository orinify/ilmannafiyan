Handling Criticism Strategies:

1. Assess whether the criticism is a genuine feedback or merely a reaction.
2. Identify areas for improvement from the feedback and establish SMART goals accordingly.
3. Evaluate the lasting impact of emotionally-driven criticism by asking yourself if it will still affect you in a week's time; if not, consider disregarding it.
4. Determine if the criticism conflicts with your core principles, such as your ideals, religious beliefs, or family values.
5. Consider the influence of the critic in your life and weigh the significance of their opinion.
6. In professional settings, actively engage with work-related criticism and focus on self-improvement efforts.
